## Purpose

This project is a starting point for building my GitHub portfolio. It helps me practice writing clean code, using Git, and documenting projects.

---

## Features

- Two-body orbital simulation
- Leapfrog integration method
- Tracking kinetic, potential, and total energy
- Plotting orbits and energy over time

---

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

---

## Running the Program

Run the simulation with:

```bash
python nbody.py
